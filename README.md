# neovim-dotfiles

Just my neovim config

Good for frontend nodejs and react development, the init-smaller.vim file is
probably what you want to use unless you want to deal with some of my stranger
preferences, and don't need golang support.

### System dependencies:

Generally failing to have one of these installed will only show an error
message, but vim will still work.

- typescript
- look \*
- words \*
- libuv
- the_silver_searcher
- python-pynvim \*
- fzf \*
- markdownlint \*
- proselint \*
- write-good \*
- tidy \*
- scsslint\*\*
- eslint\*\*
- eslint_d\*\*
- nodejs

\* = Not if you are using init-smaller.vim
\*\* = Available on npm

### Running

Run PlugInstall at first run and things should work
